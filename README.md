## Usage

![Randomly generated boxes and circles in waves](/random-color-test-screenshot.png)

There is no user interaction. The application uses CSS and Javascript to generate pseudo-randomly colored divs in a repeating pattern that change shape and brightness in a loop. The colors change at pseudo-random times.
